# {{code}} Winter CMS Theme

This theme uses [Winter Mix](https://wintercms.com/docs/console/asset-compilation) for asset compilation. It also uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting Started

1. Run [`artisan mix:install`](https://wintercms.com/docs/console/asset-compilation#mix-install) and agree when asked to modify the `package.json` file for your project in order to register & install this theme's dependencies.
2. Run [`artisan mix:compile -p theme-{{code}} --production`](https://wintercms.com/docs/console/asset-compilation#mix-compile) to compile the asset files for this theme.
3. Optionally, run [`artisan mix:watch theme-{{code}}`](https://wintercms.com/docs/console/asset-compilation#mix-watch) while actively working on the theme to have the assets automatically recompiled in the background for you every time you make a change.
