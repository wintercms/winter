[Winter](https://wintercms.com) is a Content Management System (CMS) and web platform whose sole purpose is to make your development workflow simple again. It was born out of frustration with existing systems. We feel building websites has become a convoluted and confusing process that leaves developers unsatisfied. We want to turn you around to the simpler side and get back to basics.

Winter's mission is to show the world that web development is not rocket science.

The development of Winter is lead by [Luke Towers](https://luketowers.ca/), along with many wonderful people that dedicate their time to help support and grow the community.

## Foundation library

The CMS is built on top of the wildly-popular [Laravel](https://laravel.com) PHP framework, with the in-house [Storm](https://github.com/wintercms/storm) Library as a buffer between the Laravel Framework and the CMS project to minimize breaking changes and improve stability.
