## Learning Winter

The best place to learn Winter is by [reading the documentation](https://wintercms.com/docs) or [following some tutorials](https://wintercms.com/blog/category/tutorials). You can also join the maintenance team and our active community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/D5MFSPH6Ux) who are always willing to help out with questions.

## Development team

Winter was forked from October CMS in March 2021 due to a difference in open source management philosophies between the core maintainer team and the two founders of October.

The development of Winter is lead by [Luke Towers](https://luketowers.ca/), along with many wonderful people that dedicate their time to help support and grow the community.

## Foundation library

Winter is built on top of the wildly-popular [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework for PHP, with the in-house [Storm](https://github.com/wintercms/storm) library as a buffer between the Laravel framework and the Winter project, to minimize breaking changes and improve stability.
